```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

This is a test post to check out creating and posting blog posts on the site. I will try to:

1. embed a photo
2. embed R code

Here is the photo :)

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("DJI_0334 (Small).jpg")
```

Now I'm going to try and embed some R code.

```{r, layout="1-body-outset", fig.width=6, fig.height=1.5}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_grid(~ cut)
```
